will use a simple web app to give each participant the URL to a unique instance
running Jupyter Lab.

* Using AWS IAM, add a user with permissions to tag EC2 instances

* Make an access key for the instance tagging user

* Make an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2 AMI

* amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 python3.8

* Set up .aws/config and .aws/credentials files with the access key for the
  instance tagging user

* Install Boto3

* Copy the "for_welcome_site" files to the instance

* Assign an Elastic IP to the instance

* Set a DNS record for "welcome.openmcworkshop.org" to that IP

* Set an NGINX reverse proxy that directs HTTP/HTTPS traffic to
  http://127.0.0.1:8888

* Get SSL certs with LetsEncrypt
